Weather Prediction Model
This is a Python script that demonstrates how to analyze and process weather data using pandas. The script focuses on a dataset containing local weather observations, including precipitation, snowfall, snow depth, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
pandas library
Usage
Make sure you have the required prerequisites installed.
Download the local_weather.csv file and place it in the same directory as the script.
Run the script using a Python IDE or by executing the command python weather_prediction_model.py in the terminal.
Functionality
The script reads the weather data from the CSV file and displays the DataFrame.
It calculates the percentage of missing values in each column of the weather DataFrame.
The script creates a new DataFrame called core_weather containing only the columns of interest (precipitation, snowfall, snow depth, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature).
It further cleans the core_weather DataFrame by removing unnecessary columns and filling missing values using forward filling method.
The script checks the data types of columns in the core_weather DataFrame and converts the index to a DateTime index.
It performs basic data analysis, including plotting the maximum and minimum temperature over time and counting the number of observations per year.
Finally, the script displays the output and visualization.
Feel free to modify the script according to your specific requirements and add more analysis or prediction functionalities.

Please note that the script assumes the local_weather.csv file is in the same format and structure as the provided example. Make sure your data follows a similar structure or make necessary modifications to the script to accommodate your data format.
